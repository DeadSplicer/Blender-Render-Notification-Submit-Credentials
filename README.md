<i>For this file, you add your login info and sendto address to the .py file and save it before installing it as an add-on</i>

 HOW TO USE:
 <br><br>
 I recommend you make a Gmail account specifically to send render notifications.
 <br><br>
 Go to your Google Security Settings and enable 2-factor authentication, then go to App Passwords and Create New. Call it "Blender" and copy the 16 character code.
 <br><br>
 Open the render_notif_2025.py file in a text editor and replace the info in the "INSERT YOUR INFORMATION HERE" section to match your gmail_user (send from), gmail_password (16 character app code), sent_from (send from again) & send to address (what email/phone you want to receive the notification)
 <br><br>
   (note: you can send messages from email accounts to your phone via SMS - ex. Verizon users can send to 1115551234@vtext.com to have it delivered as a text)
   <br><br>
   Save the file
   <br><br>
